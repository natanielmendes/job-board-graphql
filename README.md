# Job Board app using Graphql

This app was implemented and improved while attending [GraphQL by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-by-example/?referralCode=7ACEB04674F000BAC061) course.

Install the dependencies

`npm install`

Run the project on your local environment

`npm start`

There are local files with database entity entries such as jobs available and users. 
- Graphql queries when pulling data (jobs, users and companies) from these files.
- Graphql mutations for adding more entries (jobs / users / companies) into these files.
