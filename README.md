# Job Board app using Graphql

Playground app used in the [GraphQL by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-by-example/?referralCode=7ACEB04674F000BAC061) course.

Install the dependencies

`npm install`

Run the project on your local environment

`npm start`

There are local files with database entity entries such as jobs available and users. 
- Graphql queries will pull data (jobs, users and companies) from these files.
- Graphql mutations will add more data (jobs, users and companies) into these files.
