# Job Board app using Graphql

Sample application used in the [GraphQL by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-by-example/?referralCode=7ACEB04674F000BAC061) course.

Install the dependencies

`npm install`

Run the project

`npm start`

There's a local file with the database entity entries such as jobs available and users. Graphql queries will pull data (jobs, users and companies) from these files.
